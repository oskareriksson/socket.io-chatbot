# Socket.io-chatbot - School assignment

### School: Lernia Stockholm, Sweden.

### Program: JavaScript Developer - Front End, YHJUST16.

### Course: Advanced Web Application Development 1.

In this assignment I'll be building a small chatbot.

The page consists of a chatbox where the messages will be presented, a username input which will disappear after it has "logged" your username and a regular chat input.

The requirements for this assignment is:

* Write the backend using ExpressJS
* index.html needs to be rendered using a template engine (I used PugJS) but the chatbot communicates through websockets
* The application uses socket.io on both the client and the server to handle the communication using websockets
* The bot can answer 5 questions
* The bot has an automated answer if it doesn't recognize your command

The bot works as intended, but it doesn't look good. Might come back and improve it later, but for now it'll have to do.
